            <br></br>

        <p>I'm Tyler Yannes - I live in Austin, TX and I'm a hardworking professional with over 7 years of experience in 
            the Shopify ecommerce ecosystem. I have worked with over 100 brands to develop growth
            strategies optimizing acqusition and retention. My work experience includes Product
            Manager, Founding Strategic Account Manager, and CX Manager. I have worked at 3 
            startups as early stage hires (ranging from employee #7 to #17).
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p> I currently work for a SAAS company that powers recurring billing (subscriptions) for merchants
            on Shopify. I joined the company in March 2022 and became the first account manager to help our 
            clients optimize their subscription strategy, focusing on acqusition and retention of customers who
            have subscriptions. 
            <br></br>
        <p>
            In March of 2023, I was promoted to a hybrid Product Manager role where I assist our engineers
            in scoping out new features, managing the launch of the feature, and writing out training docs.
        </p>             <br></br>

            As a Product Manager, I manage our Data Team which includes scoping out all of our platform's analytics, coordinating with our engineers on the
            build, run the QA process, train employees on how to use analytics with clients, and write
            external facing documentation for our clients. I managed the launch of our platform's internal analytics which
            includes 6 data dashboards to showcase to merchants the value of our platform as well as understanding the 
            behavior of subscriptions.
        </p>
        <br></br>
            <p>
            In September 2023, I was able to launch my first true feature which includes a new data dashboard. The feature, Segments,
            allows our clients to splice up their data by creating custom segments of subscriptions for their store based on
            specific subscriptions met. This dashboard and feature ties together all the features of our platform and allows
            our clients to see how specific actions performed by subscriptions are importing revenue metrics as well as 
            how our platform's features are impacting these metrics.
