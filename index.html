        <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Tyler Yannes - I live in Austin, TX and I'm a hardworking professional with over 7 years of experience in 
        the Shopify ecommerce ecosystem. I have worked with over 100 brands to develop growth
        strategies optimizing acqusition and retention. My work experience includes Product
        Manager, Founding Strategic Account Manager, and CX Manager. I have worked at 3 
        startups as early stage hires (ranging from employee #7 to #17).
    </p>

    <p> In my current role, I develop strategies with my company's top clients while assisting 
        our engineers in developing out our product as Product Manager. I manage our Data Team which
        includes scoping out all of our platform's analytics, coordinating with our engineers on the
        build, run the QA process, train employees on how to use analytics with clients, and write
        external facing documentation for our clients.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of work, I am a health fanatic. I've worked for 2 health brands and have a 
        particular interest in the overlap of physical health and mental health.
